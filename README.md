### Hi, I'm Sharleen.

> "Engineering myself into someone formidable: strong mind, strong skillset, strong execution."

I am a 22-year-old Software Engineer based in South Africa, rebuilding myself from the ground up with an execution-first mindset. I approach development with deep reasoning, systems thinking, and a focus on first principles. I don't just write code; I architect systems for reliability and scale.
