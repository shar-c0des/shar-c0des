### Hi, I'm Sharleen 🎧🫧

> "Engineering myself into someone formidable: strong mind, strong skillset, strong execution."

I am a 22-year-old Software Engineer based in South Africa, rebuilding myself from the ground up with an execution-first mindset. I approach development with deep reasoning, systems thinking, and a focus on first principles. I don't just write code; I architect systems for reliability and scale.

### Active developments 💻🌐

**△ Literary Pharmacy** | *FastAPI, SQLModel, Python*
A prescriptive engine that treats literature as medicine.
* **Architecture:** Building a backend-heavy system that maps user emotional states to literary prescriptions.
* **Focus:** Implementing strict type validation and efficient database relations to handle complex query logic.

**△ The Python Arsenal** | *Pandas, Automation, Knowledge Management*
A personal automated knowledge indexing system.
* **Mechanism:** Moving away from passive tutorials to active recall. I use Python scripts to index, categorize, and surface concepts I've learned to prevent knowledge decay.

### Techn stack & interests 🌿

* **Core Engineering:** Python(main interest), SQL, System Design.
* **Current Research:** First-principles AI, Vector Databases, CRDTs, Quantitative Finance mechanisms.
* **Tools:** Linux environment, Git, Docker (Learning), Vim (or VS Code).

### My protocol 💚🌱
I view my life as an engineering problem. Every input compounds toward output.

* **Discipline:** 100% adherence to daily training and hydration. "Discipline is a system, not a mood."
* **Intellectual Diet:** Philosophy, Technical Documentation, and Financial Theory. Currently reading: *The Thinking Machine*, *Glucose Revolution*.
